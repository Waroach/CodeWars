<h1>Sum Square Difference</h1>
<h2>SOLVED</h2>
<p>The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 1powerOf2 + 2powerOf2 + ... 10powerOf2 = 385</p>
<p>the square sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 + .... 10)powerOf2 == 55powerOf2 = 3025</p>
<p>Hence the Difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square fo the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640</p>
<p>Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.</p>
