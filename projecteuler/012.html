<h1>Highly Divisible Triangular Number</h1>
<h2>NOT SOLVED</h2>
<p>he sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:</p>
<p>1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45,55,...</p>
<p>let us list the factors of the first seven triangles numbers</br>
1:1</br>
3:1,3</br>
6:1,2,3,6</br>
10:1,2,5,10</br>
15:1,3,5,15</br>
21:1,3,7,21</br>
28:1,2,4,7,14,28</br>
</p>
<p>We can see the 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.</p>
<p>What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?</p>

function trianglurNumber(){
    // need to find a way to iterate thru problem and find triangle with x amount of divisors.
    // then once found sum those divisors together.
    // 1. Set n = 1
    // 2. Loop until a triangle number with more than 500 divisors is found:
    //  a. Calculate the triangle number T_n using T_n = n * (n + 1) / 2
    //  b. Find the number of divisors of T_n
    //  i. Initialize divisor_count = 0
    //  ii. Loop from i = 1 to sqrt(T_n):
    //      If T_n is divisible by i, count both i and T_n / i as divisors (unless they are the same).
    //   c. If divisor_count > 500, break the loop and return T_n
    //   d. Otherwise, increment n and repeat.
    
    let n = 1

// Set the result of problem() to the <p> element
