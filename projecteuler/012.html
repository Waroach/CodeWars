<h1>Highly Divisible Triangular Number</h1>
<h2>NOT SOLVED</h2>
<p>he sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:</p>
<p>1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45,55,...</p>
<p>let us list the factors of the first seven triangles numbers</br>
1:1</br>
3:1,3</br>
6:1,2,3,6</br>
10:1,2,5,10</br>
15:1,3,5,15</br>
21:1,3,7,21</br>
28:1,2,4,7,14,28</br>
</p>
<p>We can see the 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.</p>
<p>What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?</p>

<script>


function trianglurNumber(){
    // need to find a way to iterate thru problem and find triangle with x amount of divisors.
    // then once found sum those divisors together.
}



// Set the result of problem() to the <p> element
document.getElementById("answer").innerHTML = trianglurNumber(5);

// log to console
console.log(trianglurNumber(5));
