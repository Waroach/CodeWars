Capitalize First Letter of a String
Write a method, capitalize(),
such that when the method is called on a String,
only the very first letter of the string is capitalized (if it is a letter).
For example:
"string".capitalize() === "String"
"hello World".capitalize() === "Hello World"
"i love codewars".capitalize() === "I love codewars"
"This sentence is already capitalized".capitalize() === "This sentence is already capitalized"
"0123the first character of this sentence is not a letter".capitalize() === "0123the first character of this sentence is not a letter"
