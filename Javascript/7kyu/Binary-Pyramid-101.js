Given two numbers m and n, such that 0 â‰¤ m â‰¤ n :
convert all numbers from m to n (inclusive) to binary
sum them as if they were in base 10
convert the result to binary
return as a string
Example
1, 4  -->  1111010
because:
    1  // 1 in binary is 1
+  10  // 2 in binary is 10
+  11  // 3 in binary is 11
+ 100  // 4 in binary is 100
-----
  122  // 122 in binary is 1111010
