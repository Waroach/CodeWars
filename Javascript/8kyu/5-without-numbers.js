function unusualFive() {
  let five = "fivve";
  return five.length;
}

// First Try
// function unusualFive() {
//   let five = ["h", "u", "i", "j", "g"]
//   return five.length
// }

// pseudocode
// we have to find a method that returns a number depending on certain results.
// we could use things like .legth. or grab the index of something.

Write a function that always returns 5
Sounds easy right? Just bear in mind that you can't use any of the following characters: 0123456789*+-/
Good luck :)
